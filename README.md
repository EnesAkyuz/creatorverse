About this web app: **Visit Live App At: https://creatorverse-codepath-enes-25i0.onrender.com/**

Creatorverse is a small React Web Application I have created for CodePath. It allows users to add their favorite content creators and their socials, delete them or edit information about them! Currently, it is open for everyone, I shall close the database connection when my codepath submission is accepted.
